[00:01] Hi everyone, I'm Alice.
[00:02] I'm going to show you just how easy it is to connect your Brex account to Puzzle,
[00:06] where you'll get real-time accounting and startup metrics.
[00:09] When you sign up for Puzzle, you'll receive the option at onboarding to connect your Brex account right away,
[00:15] or you can choose to do it later.
[00:16] Or maybe if you forgot, that's okay, just log back into Puzzle,
[00:19] go into your dashboard and click on integrations.
[00:21] You'll see the option here to connect your Brex account again.
[00:25] Go ahead and log into Brex and you'll get to this screen.
[00:28] Click 'allow access', and this will bring you back to Puzzle,
[00:32] where you will choose your import date for the transactions.
[00:35] Let's go with what they have here.
[00:37] Click 'start importing'.
[00:39] What this does is this brings over every single Brex transaction in your operating account and in your Brex credit card over to Puzzle.
[00:47] We do this via direct API and it's really magical and it's going to save you so much time.
[00:53] Let me show you how.
[00:55] Over in the transactions tab, where you can filter by date,
[00:58] I want to show you all of the Brex data that has been brought over.
[01:03] You can see all these Brex transactions.
[01:05] If we click on one, you can now see that the vendor has been brought over,
[01:11] the transaction date,
[01:13] you'll see the institution, the source account and, best of all,
[01:17] Puzzlebot will auto-categorize 99% of all the Brex credit card data.
[01:23] So you don't actually have to go in and figure out what the transaction was for, or figure out what the accounting category was for, either.
[01:31] And if you have a question about the transaction, you can either request a category review, get more documentation or request context from someone else on your team.
[01:40] Wait, that's not all.
[01:42] When you scroll down through transactions and you see this symbol, it means that there's an attached receipt that has been synced over from Brex.
[01:52] Let's take a look.
[01:53] When you open the transaction and you scroll down, you'll see the receipt right in here from this Brex integration.
[02:02] So you don't have to go chasing for supporting documents anymore or spend time switching between two systems to get the full context.
[02:09] Another great thing about our Brex API is when it comes to month-end close.
[02:15] Maybe you do it or your bookkeeper does it.
[02:17] What we actually do is we have automated pre-validation reconciliation checks that make your bank reconciliations run 20% faster.
[02:26] So that's how easy it is to connect Brex.
[02:28] Another great thing about this Brex API because all of your transactions are brought over to Puzzle in real time,
[02:36] you'll be able to see startup metrics like today's cash,
[02:41] net burn in multiple different ways, and also your runway,
[02:46] in addition to all the financial statements that you need for investor reporting, fundraising or even taxes.
[02:52] All of this is in real time.
