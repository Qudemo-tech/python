# Loom Video Processing Fix Summary

## Problem Description

When processing Loom videos with "anyone can view" access links, the Python backend was failing with FFmpeg errors like:
```
moov atom not found
Invalid data found when processing input
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the Loom video download process:

1. **CDN Access Denied**: The Loom CDN URLs were returning 403 (forbidden) errors
2. **HTML Fallback**: When CDN access failed, the system was falling back to downloading the Loom share page URL, which is HTML content, not a video file
3. **FFmpeg Failure**: FFmpeg was trying to process HTML content as if it were a video file, causing the "moov atom not found" error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Prioritized yt-dlp Download**
- Changed the download strategy to use `yt-dlp` as the primary method
- `yt-dlp` has excellent built-in support for Loom videos and handles authentication properly
- Falls back to API/CDN methods only if `yt-dlp` fails

### 2. **Added File Validation**
- Implemented `validate_video_file()` method to check downloaded files
- Validates file size, extension, and file signatures
- Detects HTML content and prevents FFmpeg from processing invalid files
- Automatically removes invalid files and retries with fallback methods

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better error messages and logging
- Graceful fallback between different download methods
- Prevents returning HTML URLs that would cause FFmpeg to fail

### 4. **Enhanced Main Processing**
- Better error handling in `main.py` for Loom video processing
- Graceful fallback to standard video processing methods if Loom processing fails
- More detailed logging for debugging

## Code Changes

### `loom_video_processor.py`
- **`download_loom_video()`**: Now prioritizes yt-dlp over API/CDN methods
- **`validate_video_file()`**: New method to validate downloaded files
- **`get_loom_video_url()`**: Improved to avoid returning HTML URLs

### `main.py`
- Enhanced error handling for Loom video processing
- Better fallback mechanisms
- More detailed logging

## Testing

Created `test_loom_fix.py` to verify the fixes:
- Tests yt-dlp direct download
- Tests the Loom processor with validation
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

## Usage

The fixes are automatically applied when processing Loom videos. The system will:

1. Try yt-dlp download first (most reliable)
2. Fall back to API method if yt-dlp fails
3. Fall back to CDN method if API fails
4. Validate all downloaded files before processing
5. Gracefully fall back to standard video processing if all Loom methods fail

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Loom videos should download successfully using yt-dlp
- ✅ Downloaded files should be validated as actual video files
- ✅ FFmpeg should process valid video files without errors
- ✅ System should gracefully handle failures and fall back to other methods
- ✅ Detailed logging should help with debugging

## Environment Requirements

- `yt-dlp` must be installed (already in requirements.txt)
- FFmpeg must be installed system-wide
- No additional environment variables required (LOOM_API_KEY is optional)
