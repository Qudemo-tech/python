[00:00:00] All right.
[00:00:01] It's time to check out my absolute favorite feature in Puzzle.
[00:00:04] Check this out.
[00:00:05] We're on the Puzzle dashboard.
[00:00:07] We're going to scroll down to the cash activity tab.
[00:00:10] And then look over here at this toggle called Spotlight.
[00:00:13] Spotlight allows me to identify notable changes in my cash activity from a previous month to today.
[00:00:20] When I click into the settings,
[00:00:22] you can see that I can spotlight changes that are greater than either a certain percentage,
[00:00:26] we're going to choose 25%,
[00:00:28] um or greater than a certain dollar amount.
[00:00:31] All right, save the setting, let's scroll down.
[00:00:34] I can see that most things are looking good to go, except for this one.
[00:00:37] It looks like there is a spotlight on my spending from um Amazon Web Services.
[00:00:42] I know that I better go check that out in the spending tab and see if everything is um as I'm expecting it.
[00:00:48] It's just so awesome that Puzzle shows me where I should look,
[00:00:51] when I need to look,
[00:00:52] and uh highlights the things that matter most.
[00:00:54] Go check it out.
