--- TRANSCRIPTION ---
[00:00:00] Hi, I'm Luke Fry,
[00:00:02] a CPA
[00:00:03] and head of customer success
[00:00:05] and accountant training at Puzzle.
[00:00:07] I was the first accountant at Bench
[00:00:09] and managed a team of over 50 bookkeepers,
[00:00:12] had my own tax practice and
[00:00:14] before joining Puzzle was a pilot.
[00:00:17] So, I'd like to show you as an accountant what I've always wanted from a software.
[00:00:22] The first thing you're gonna see on the dashboard besides the automated reports that are pulled in
[00:00:28] is your dashboard which
[00:00:30] also has today's cash, the net burn,
[00:00:33] and runway rate automatically calculated in addition to these charts.
[00:00:37] One thing that makes Puzzle unique is
[00:00:39] we actually have what we call real-time accounting, meaning as soon as the transactions are available, they're posted into the financials.
[00:00:47] While that may be scary at times if a client is relying on information that's not complete, we're also highlighting the fact that
[00:00:54] there's some transactions that need to be categorized, finalized,
[00:00:58] uh, as well as the reconciliations that need to be done.
[00:01:01] So, balancing that relevance with reliability by indicating how complete those transactions are.
[00:01:08] Also, uh, we have the ability to assign transactions to users in the system.
[00:01:14] Uh, for example, this Linear transaction, maybe it's not clear uh either what this is for which we could ask our AI
[00:01:21] or maybe we need to amortize it over a bigger period or match it to a bill.
[00:01:25] So, all these things you can do to assign
[00:01:29] transactions either to other bookkeepers you're working with or your client helps streamline that process.
[00:01:36] Additionally, Puzzle has everything you would expect from an accounting software including bank reconciliations, chart of accounts, general ledger,
[00:01:44] manual journal entries and so on.
[00:01:47] Um, the nice thing about the bank reconciliations is we're automatically drafting them for you because we're built on APIs, we're pulling everything that we can including API balances for some banks automatically.
[00:02:00] which should make reconciliation a three-click process that goes very quickly.
[00:02:05] If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to look at puzzle.io.
[00:02:10] Uh, lots of features coming including transfer over from your current system.
[00:02:14] Thanks so much.
