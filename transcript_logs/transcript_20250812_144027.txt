[00:00:00] Hello, I'm the CEO of Puzzle, and we've been shipping so many features.
[00:00:04] I figured I'd just give everybody a quick update and a demo of what it does.
[00:00:08] So, what you're looking at is the dashboard.
[00:00:10] Now this is all software generated.
[00:00:12] I just seeded the data in.
[00:00:14] Takes about two minutes to get everything set up.
[00:00:16] You don't need any background in accounting or finance.
[00:00:19] And what you're going to immediately notice is you're going to see all of your cash across all of your different accounts.
[00:00:24] You're going to see your burn, net burn, bank burn.
[00:00:27] If you want to know anything, you can just click and see your own data.
[00:00:29] And then your revenue run rate.
[00:00:31] See some charts here plotting burn and spending and revenue over time, of course.
[00:00:35] I'm going to show you two of my favorite features across accounting, finance, and just other things that I think are important to know.
[00:00:43] So this is one of the coolest parts I think here is if you don't know anything about accounting, all you have to do is know how to click to understand and see what your expenses are.
[00:00:52] You want to know how much you spent at GitHub, great.
[00:00:56] You can click here, you can see the charge, you can see who spent it.
[00:00:59] You have transactions that might have a lot of transactions together.
[00:01:03] Our system just automatically aggregates and sorts and puts everything together.
[00:01:08] One of the other really cool features is um your accounts usually like to do accrual books, but you really want to see cash books cuz you're a founder, you can't really pay payroll or other vendors um with accruals, you can pay with cash.
[00:01:21] So for the first time ever, you get to see both.
[00:01:23] You don't have to choose, which is pretty cool.
[00:01:27] Next, I think one of my other favorite features here is this like spending explorer.
[00:01:31] You get to see really quickly all of the top places you're spending money.
[00:01:35] And you get different views, top categories, top vendors, top purchases, one-time or recurring.
[00:01:40] You want to dive deep into trends, you can sort of just click and see everything together.
[00:01:45] Similarly on revenue, like what's the revenue in cash revenue and accrual revenue and ARR, MRR.
[00:01:51] If you're a software company, you maybe want to see ARR, MRR by customer.
[00:01:55] All you have to do is click and you can see cuz they're all technically right, they just tell a little bit of a different story.
[00:02:02] And our system is automatically doing all of your deferrals, all of your recognized revenue and showing you the schedule.
[00:02:09] Similarly, if you want to sort of take a look, you have a single view of all of your transactions.
[00:02:14] Now, how does this come in handy?
[00:02:16] Well, let's say there's an Apple transaction and you didn't add a receipt and you don't really know what this is.
[00:02:22] You can just click AI categorizer.
[00:02:24] This will send you an email.
[00:02:25] You can also do an in-app message.
[00:02:27] Um, this was a computer for an engineer.
[00:02:33] We should probably spell this right.
[00:02:35] Um, all I have to do is click send.
[00:02:36] I don't need to know anything about accounting or anything about general ledger accounts.
[00:02:41] All I see here is here it shows up in my fixed assets.
[00:02:44] It automatically generates a schedule.
[00:02:47] Means for the next three years, you don't longer have to create a manual journal entry to depreciating this asset.
[00:02:53] It's just all done automatically.
[00:02:55] Now a lot of this is like, okay, this is great, but how do I know whether this is correct or not?
[00:03:00] Well, here we built something called a smart checklist.
[00:03:02] So every accountant has a certain set of steps that they do every month, and we automate just about all of them.
[00:03:09] And then we also review to see if it's right.
[00:03:11] So you want to make sure your data is complete.
[00:03:14] This is called a bank reconciliation or credit card reconciliation in the world of accounting.
[00:03:17] But effectively, it's like making sure you have all of the pieces of the puzzle.
[00:03:21] Well, we've automatically prepared this for you, and you can see the difference is zero.
[00:03:25] So you have confidence that your data is complete.
[00:03:28] And then you can go through and we do a bunch of sanity checks.
[00:03:31] It shows you all of the places where you need to put attention all in very sort of general human understanding language.
[00:03:38] Now there's obviously a lot more features here to show you, but um this is just some of the coolest stuff to uh help you out.
[00:03:45] Uh, we'd love to hear what you think.
[00:03:47] And if you have anything else that you would like us to build, please let us know.
[00:03:50] All right, thanks.
