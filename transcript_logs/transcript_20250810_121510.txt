[00:00:00] Now, we know Apple could be a variety of things.
[00:00:03] We don't know what it is.
[00:00:04] So we can ask AI if we don't know what Apple is.
[00:00:07] And it will generate what the vendor is, some potential categories, and some accounting tips.
[00:00:14] But even after this, if we just don't really know, we can request a category review via email like this.
[00:00:22] Here's that same Apple transaction.
[00:00:24] We noticed that the AI had categorized it as computers and hardware, marked as capitalizable.
[00:00:31] It created and suggested the vendor Apple.
[00:00:33] It gave all the notes down here, and here's the response from the email.
[00:00:38] The interesting thing is, if we go over here to the accounting tab, to the fixed asset register, we see it automatically recorded a fixed asset and generated a depreciation schedule automatically.
[00:00:50] Pretty cool, right?
