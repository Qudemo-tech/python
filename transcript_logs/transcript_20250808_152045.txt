All right, it's time to check out my absolute favorite feature in Puzzle. Check this out. We're on the Puzzle dashboard. We're going to scroll down to the cash activity tab, and then look over here at this toggle called Spotlight. Spotlight allows me to identify notable changes in my cash activity from a previous month to today. When I click into the settings, you can see that I can spotlight changes that are greater than either a certain percentage, we're going to choose 25%, um or greater than a certain dollar amount. All right, save the setting. Let's scroll down. I can see that most things are looking good to go, except for this one. It looks like there is a spotlight on my spending from um Amazon Web Services. I know that I better go check that out in the spending tab and see if everything is um as I'm expecting it. It's just so awesome that Puzzle shows me where I should look when I need to look and uh highlights the things that matter most. Go check it out.
