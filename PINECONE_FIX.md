# Pinecone Package Fix

## **Problem**
```
Exception: The official Pinecone python package has been renamed from `pinecone-client` to `pinecone`. 
Please remove `pinecone-client` from your project dependencies and add `pinecone` instead.
```

## **Solution**

### **Updated Package Name:**
- ❌ `pinecone-client>=2.2.0` (old)
- ✅ `pinecone>=3.0.0` (new)

### **Files Updated:**
1. ✅ `requirements-python312.txt`
2. ✅ `requirements.txt`
3. ✅ `requirements-minimal.txt`

### **Import Statement:**
The import in `main.py` is already correct:
```python
from pinecone import Pinecone  # ✅ This is correct
```

## **Why This Happened**

Pinecone officially renamed their Python package:
- **Old package**: `pinecone-client`
- **New package**: `pinecone`
- **Same functionality**: Just a package name change

## **Verification**

After deployment, the application should:
- ✅ Import Pinecone successfully
- ✅ Connect to Pinecone index
- ✅ Perform vector operations
- ✅ No package naming errors

## **Next Steps**

1. **Redeploy** with updated requirements
2. **Test Pinecone functionality**
3. **Verify vector operations work**
4. **Monitor for any other issues**

The Pinecone package fix should resolve the import error and allow the application to start successfully.
